# Sintra project - The slacker page
The slacker page is intended to provide slackers a platform to save or plan out their dream vacation spot or getaways. Users are encouraged to sign up and create an account to be even more efficient at slacking off. Creating an account with the app will enable the user to plan out or save all of their dream vacation spots in one place. Whenever user's mind needs some "me time" and need to let loose, they can log in to their accounter. Then the user can decide whether to create a new dream wonderland or day dream about what they could be doing at their "lalaland"(or simply drool over the welcome page). Basically, procrastinating to their heart's content and doing anything and everything except whatever they should be doing.   


## Installation

None needed, you can simply enter the page if the creator ever decide to set it up on heroku....

## Usage
Use the page to daydream or plan out anywhere you want to go or things you want to do. so have fun.
